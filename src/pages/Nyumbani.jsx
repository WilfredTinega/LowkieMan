          Hi there! 👋 I'm a <strong>coding enthusiast</strong>  with a knack for turning caffeine into clean, efficient code (mostly).
        </p>
        <p>
          Think of me as your friendly neighborhood developer who talks to computers better than humans <tt>though I'm working on it!.</tt>  </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not wrestling with bugs that think they're smarter than me, you can find me googling <b>“how to center an image in CSS”</b> for the hundredth time 
          <tt>(because some things never stick)</tt>, or obsessively tweaking my projects until my code editor threatens to quit.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thrive on challenges, love solving problems, and enjoy building cool stuff that makes life easier—or at least more fun. 
          Whether it's nesting React routers like a pro or figuring out why a semicolon broke the world, I'm all in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, and I'm always down for a chat about tech, engineering, or the eternal mystery of <code>*why developers hate CSS*</code>. 
          Let's connect and build something awesome together! 🚀
        </p>
